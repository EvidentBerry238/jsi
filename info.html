            <h2 class="part1">It’s time to explore new ways to approach mental health and masculinity</h2>
            <div class="text-item">
                <p>Conversations about mental health are constantly stigmatized, and there can be a lot of shame or judgment around struggling with mental illnesses. This is especially true when it comes to discussing masculinity and mental health, as toxic masculinity can make it difficult or even impossible for men to come forward about their mental health problems. </p>  <br>
                <p>The consequences are deadly: more than 4 times as many men as women die by suicide in the United States, and suicide is the 7th leading cause of death in males. Because it is more socially unacceptable for men to discuss their feelings, men tend to downplay their symptoms, bottle up their emotions, and are less likely to seek help for whatever they may be struggling with. </p> <br>
                <p>June is Men’s Health Month, and it’s important that we start having conversations about men’s mental health too. This means teaching children of all genders about emotional needs, awareness, and communication at an early age, so they’re able to find healthy coping mechanisms and develop skills to manage their emotions. </p> <br>

            <img class="info-img2" src="pictures/img-2.png" alt=""> 
            <div class="text-item">
                <p>A commonly held assumption is that women are just more likely than men to have some kind of mental illness, such as depression or anxiety. However, the reality is that many men are discouraged from seeking out treatment for their mental health problems due to societal standards and expectations. </p>  <br>
                <p>Symptoms of mental health conditions in men may manifest themselves in more socially acceptable alternatives to sadness, such as anger. These symptoms can include irritability, difficulty concentrating, substance abuse, and suicide ideation. </p> <br>
                <p>Because conversations about mental health tend to center around women, it is important to acknowledge and address the unique barriers to care that exist in male populations, especially in queer men, men of color, and lower-income men. </p> <br>
